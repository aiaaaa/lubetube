# lubetube

Hello World!

Welcome to the README for the lubetube project (formerly the Liquid Lightsho Arduino)

Please see our youtube page for some setup pictures, as well as recorded art

lubetube is an homage to the classic americana 1960s artform 'liquid lightshow'

This style of visual art incorperates:
-a flat lightsourse (historically a overhead projector)
-two concave glass plates (tipically grandfather clock glass)
-two non-miscible solvents with dye (genearlly organic and aqueous)
-a method of projecting or recording the liquid patters generated between the glass layers

In this project we will develop increasinly complex methods of generating these pattersn with robotic actuation.

Rev1
See video - XXXXXX
This revision utilizes 3 server motors to pull the top glass up and down

Rev2
This future revision with utilize stepper motors to give smoother control
